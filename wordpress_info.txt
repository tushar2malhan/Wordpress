Hosting two instances at Once  Sharing the same DB mysql

	Don't forget that every wordpress service will need it's own database. 
	You can either define for each wordpress service it's own database 
	service or use single (shared) DB service and create on it 
	multiple databases (one for each wordpress service).

	To do so first start up only db and phpmyadmin services using:

	|	 docker-compose up -d db phpmyadmin		|

	Since PhpMyAdmin is set to be exposed on port 8080 go to http://localhost:8080,
	log in and create for each wordpress service it's own database and user.
	Here create User and DB based WORDPRESS_DB_ variables based in docker compose yaml file

	Once done, update WORDPRESS_DB_* env variables (if needed) 
	in docker-compose.yaml to match databases and user credentials
	you just created in yaml file and if everything is ok start all wordpress services.

	Based on example docker-compose.yaml you should be able to access:

	http://localhost:8000/wp-admin/update-core.php		-> wordpress site 1 
	http://localhost:8001/wp-admin/update-core.php		-> wordpress site 2
